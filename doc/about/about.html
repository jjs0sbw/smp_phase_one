	 <p>General ---- Version 0.01.00<br>
	 This web application is designed to support the testing and improvement of <br>
	 structural modeling techniques and methods.  Structural modeling is used to create <br>
	 a system structure from a disorganized and unordered set of objects.  To properly <br>
	 test the structuring methods and techniques, a system with known order is selected <br>
	 and scrambled into a ramdom system state.  This ramdom, unstructured system is then <br>
	 structured using the methods and techniques associated with structural modeling. When<br>
	 the ordering process is complete, the final output from the process is checked against<br>
	 The known system structure.<br>
	 <br>
	 This web application supports structural modeling by organizing and presenting a web<br>
	 based interface to a set of general structural modeling grids.  Theses general structural<br> modeling grids support a range of system structuring approaches. At this time, the <br>
   application supports three distinct structuring approaches. These three appraoches are <br>
   based on the software commands from the GMU ISM software.
